Clone the project to local.

To run the project, first you need to install all the libraries for this project.

Next, you just need to run the file "main.py", the data will be automatically updated and processed to get the prediction of the air quality.

If you want to build a new model, you must run the "Train_model.py" and then the model will store at /Model/Built_Model. If you want to use that model you need to change the name of model in "main.py"
