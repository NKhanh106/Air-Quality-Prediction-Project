# Air-Quality-Prediction-Project
Predict the air quality of Hanoi.

Clone the project to local.

To run the project, first you need to come to the url : "https://aqicn.org/historical/vn/#!city:vietnam/hanoi" and get the nearest data and then store it to \Data with the name "AQI"

Next, you just need to run the file "main.py" to get the prediction of the air quality.

If you want to build a new model, you must run the "Train_model.py" and then the model will store at /Model/Built_Model. If you want to use that model you need to change the name of model in "main.py"

Thanks for reading.
